# TF_Variables_and_Outputs
Detailed look at different variable types, inputs, and outputs

Goes into detail regarding terraform.tfvars folder, additional variable files, -var, output commands, local values, and data sources.

The folders are missing the ".terraform" and the ".lock" files, because these files are too large for github. Please use your own environment variables and commit with command "terraform init" to get your own .terraform and .lock files.
